# Web-Scraping

In this repository I have done some web scraping using Beautiful Soup.

Basically this Python file takes two inputs :-

If you press 1 the scrapping will happen on the basis of the URL that you provide.

And If you press 2 the scrapping of the data will happen on the basis if the keyword that you input.


## Hope this Web Scrapping Tool will help you :)
